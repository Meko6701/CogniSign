## About

CogniSign is a revolutionary project that aims to bridge communication gaps and enhance educational opportunities for the deaf community. By combining advanced neural network architectures and computer vision techniques, CogniSign enables real-time recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures, transforming them into letters and words.

## Key Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection and recognition.
- Integration of OpenCV for hand region segmentation and noise reduction.
- Custom-built neural network architecture designed for ASL recognition.
- Seamless transformation of ASL gestures into letters and words.

## Technical Overview

CogniSign's technical architecture revolves around the synergy of computer vision and machine learning. The core components include:

- **OpenCV Integration:** Captures and processes real-time video feed, performs hand detection, and isolates the hand region.
- **Neural Network Architecture:** A meticulously designed neural network with convolutional and recurrent layers trained on an ASL dataset for accurate recognition.
- **Real-time Processing:** Combines OpenCV and the neural network to instantly decipher ASL gestures, presenting them as letters and words.
